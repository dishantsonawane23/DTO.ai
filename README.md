Welcome to our GitHub repository dedicated to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning resources! This repository contains self-written documents that explain the working of various machine learning algorithms in a simple and easy-to-understand manner. Our goal is to make these resources accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of technical expertise.

In addition to the self-written documents, we have also provided a link to a web view of these resources, making it easy for you to view and interact with them online. We believe that access to knowledge is key to the development and growth of the field of Artificial Intelligence, and we hope that these resources will serve as a valuable tool for anyone interested in learning more about this exciting field.

We encourage you to explore the resources in this repository, ask questions, and share your feedback with us. We hope that you will find this repository helpful, and we look forward to collaborating with you in the future!
